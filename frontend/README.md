This is the frontend of the Rozgaar Mitra job portal, built using React and Material UI.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or above recommended)

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

3. Start the frontend server:

## 🧼 Common Fixes

- If the app fails to start, delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- If ports are busy, kill the process using:
  ```bash
  npx kill-port 3000
  ```
